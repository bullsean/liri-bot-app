# liri-node-app

Similar to Apple's popular SIRI, Liri receives commands as your personal DJ, movie and concert assistant. This app utilizes the Node CLI to input your commands and return the results.

### Dependencies: 
Axios, Node-Spotify-API, Moment, DotEnv
  - You'll also need a key to the OMDB, Bands in Town, and Spotify APIs
  
### How it works:

Liri accepts commands and does a search based on your query. Below you'll find the four commands and their associated results.

#### Get concert info for you favorite artist!

```
concert-this <artist name>
```
![Concert This](https://github.com/bullsean/liri-bot-app/blob/master/assets/images/Concert%20Search%20Results.JPG?raw=true)


#### Get song information straight from Spotify and preview the song!

```
spotify-this-song <song name>
```
![Spotify This Song](https://github.com/bullsean/liri-bot-app/blob/master/assets/images/Spotify-This-Song%20With%20Command%20Results.JPG?raw=true)


#### Get movie stats!

```
movie-this <movie title>
```
![Movie This](https://github.com/bullsean/liri-bot-app/blob/master/assets/images/Movie-This%20With%20Command%20Results.JPG?raw=true)



#### Or just leave it to chance

```
do-what-it-says
```
![Do What It Says](https://github.com/bullsean/liri-bot-app/blob/master/assets/images/Do-What-It-Says%20Command%20Results.JPG?raw=true)


If you haven't specified any concert, song or movie, Liri will return the defaults! I'll let you find out what those are.
